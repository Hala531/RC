View(starwars)
names(starwars)
#loops 

#1er exercice : 

for(i in 1:5){
  print(starwars$name[i])
}

#2ème exercice 

for (i in 1: length(starwars$height)){
  print(starwars$height[i])
}

#3ème exercice 

#create a new blank vector called  tallness 
tallness <- vector(mode = "numeric", 
                   length = 5)

#add data points to the new vector 
for (i in 1:5){
  tallness[i] <- starwars$height[i]/100
}
print(tallness)

# creating a break 

#a loop can be stopped if certain criteria are met in the exemple bellow, when looping through the vector, R will break the loop as soon as x is equal to "Darth Vader"

for(x in starwars$name){
  print(x)
  if(x == "Wedge Antilles"){
    break
  }
}

# use next to skip a data point, data points can be skipped by a condition , which if met, will prompt the loop to go to the next iteration and skip the current one. in the example bellow, C-3P0 is skipped 

for(x in starwars$name){
  if (x=="C-3PO"){
    next
  }
  print(x)
  if(x=="Darth Vader"){
    break
  }
}

#concatinate and print : this is a lovely feature of looping that allows you to create a text output that is driven by differences in each iteration . the cat function allows you to concatenate orjoin together elements of text. 

for (i in 1:5) {
  cat ("the hight of", starwars$name[i], "is", tallness[i], "metres/n")
}

```
